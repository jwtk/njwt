nJwt is the cleanest JSON Web Token (JWT) library for Node.js developers. nJwt
removes all the complexities around JWTs, and gives you a simple, intuitive API,
that allows you to securely make and use JWTs in your applications without
needing to read [rfc7519](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.txt).

### Creating Secure, Signed JWTs

JWTs expect *"claims"*, they are a set of assertions about who the user is and what
they can do.  The most common use case for JWTs is to declare the "scope" of the
access token, which is a list of things that the holder of the token (the user)
is allowed to do.

JWTs should be signed, otherwise you can't verify that they were created by you.
Our library expects that you give us a highly random signing key for
signing tokens.  We use the `HS256` algorithm by default, and the byte length of
the signing key should match that of the signing algorithm, to ensure cryptographic
security.

While the library will accept strings for signing keys, we suggest you use a
Buffer instead.  Using buffers makes it easy to do other operations, like
convert your signing key to Base64URL encoding, if you need to transmit your
key to other systems.

While the claims are completely up to you, we do recommend setting the "Subject"
and "Audience" fields.

JWTs commonly contain the `iat`, `nbf` and `exp` claims, which declare the time the
token was issued, activation date and when it expires.  Our library will create these for you (except nbf),
with a default expiration of 1 hour. `nbf` is optional.

Here is a simple example that shows you how to create a secure byte string for
your signing key, and then use that key to sign a JWT with some claims that you
provide:

````javascript
var nJwt = require('njwt');
var secureRandom = require('secure-random');

var signingKey = secureRandom(256, {type: 'Buffer'}); // Create a highly random byte array of 256 bytes

var claims = {
  iss: "http://myapp.com/",  // The URL of your service
  sub: "users/user1234",    // The UID of the user in your system
  scope: "self, admins"
}

var jwt = nJwt.create(claims,signingKey);

````

Once you have created the JWT, you can look at its internal structure by
logging it to the console.  This is our internal representation of the token,
this is not what you'll send to your end user:

````javascript
console.log(jwt);
````
````json
{
  "header": {
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
  },
  "body": {
    "jti": "c84280e6-0021-4e69-ad76-7a3fdd3d4ede",
    "iat": 1434660338,
    "exp": 1434663938,
    "nbf": 1434663938,
    "iss": "http://myapp.com/",
    "sub": "users/user1234",
    "scope": ["self","admins"]
  }
}
````
Our library has added the `jti` field for you, this is a random ID that will be
unique for every token.  You can use this if you want to create a database of
tokens that have been issued to the user.

When you are ready to give the token to your end user, you need to compact it.
This will turn it into a Base64 URL encoded string, making it safe to pass
around in browsers without any unexpected formatting applied to it.

````javascript
var token = jwt.compact();
console.log(token);
````
````

This is the JWT that the client application will retain, and use for authentication.

Your server application will also need to persist the signing key that was used
to sign the token, and when the client tries to use this token for
authentication, you will need to use the same signing key for verification.

The Buffer needs to be converted to a string so that it can be persisted in a
database, and you can do so like this:

```
var base64SigningKey = signingKey.toString('base64');
```

If you are going to use multiple signing keys, it is common practice to create a
random ID which identifies the key, and store that ID with the key in your
database.  When you create JWTs, set the `kid` field of the header to be this ID.
Then when verifying JWTs, this `kid` field will tell you which signing key should
be used for verification.

### Verifying Signed JWTs

The end user will use their JWT to authenticate themselves with your service.
When they present the JWT, you want to check the token to ensure that it's valid.
This library does the following checks when you call the `verify` method:

* It was created by you (by verifying the signature, using the secret signing key)
* It hasn't been modified (e.g. some claims were maliciously added)
* It hasn't expired
* It is active

To verify a previously issued token, use the `verify` method.  You must give it
the same signing key that you are using to create tokens:
````javascript
nJwt.verify(token,signingKey,function(err,verifiedJwt){
  if(err){
    console.log(err); // Token has expired, has been tampered with, etc
  }else{
    console.log(verifiedJwt); // Will contain the header and body
  }
});
````

If validation fails you can look at `err.message` to understand the problem.  If
the header and body of the JWT were parse-able (not not verifiable) they will
be provided as objects at `err.parsedHeader` and `err.parsedBody`.

You can also use verify synchronously, in which case the errors will be thrown:

````javascript
try{
  verifiedJwt = nJwt.verify(token,signingKey);
}catch(e){
  console.log(e);
}
````

### Changing the algorithm

If you want to change the algorithm from the default `HS256`, you can do so
by passing it as a third argument to the `create` or `verify` methods:

````javascript
var jwt = nJwt.create(claims,signingKey,'HS512');
````
````javascript
nJwt.verify(token,signingKey, 'HS512');
````

See the table below for a list of supported algorithms.  If using RSA key pairs,
the public key will be the signing key parameter.

### Customizing the token

While we've chosen secure, sensible defaults for you, you may need to change it
up.

#### Claims

If you need to provide custom claims, simply supply them to the `create` method
or add them manually to the claims body after the JWT is created.  These two
examples create the same claims body:

```javascript
var claims = {
  scope: 'admins'
}
var jwt = nJwt.create(claims,secret);
````
```javascript
var jwt = nJwt.create({},secret);
jwt.body.scope = 'admins';
````

#### Expiration Claim

A convenience method is supplied for modifying the `exp` claim.  You can modify
the `exp` claim by passing a `Date` object, or a millisecond value, to the
`setExpiration` method:

```javascript
var jwt = nJwt.create(claims,secret);

jwt.setExpiration(new Date('2015-07-01')); // A specific date
jwt.setExpiration(new Date().getTime() + (60*60*1000)); // One hour from now
jwt.setExpiration(); // Remove the exp claim
```

#### NotBefore Claim

A convenience method is supplied for modifying the `nbf` claim.  You can modify
the `nbf` claim by passing a `Date` object, or a millisecond value, to the
`setNotBefore` method:

```javascript
var jwt = nJwt.create(claims,secret);

jwt.setNotbefore(new Date('2015-07-01')); // token is active from this date
jwt.setNotbefore(new Date().getTime() + (60*60*1000)); // One hour from now
jwt.setNotbefore(); // Remove the exp claim
```

    ];
    var currentKey = 0

    // create a token
    var token = new nJwt.Jwt(claims)
      .setSigningAlgorithm('HS256')
      .setSigningKey(keys[currentKey].secret)
      .setSigningKeyId(keys[currentKey].kid)
      .compact();

    // Parse the tokent
    var jwt = new nJwt.Parser().parse(token);
    // lookup the key
    var found = keys.find(k => k.kid === jwt.header.kid)
    // then verify
    var verifier = new nJwt.Verifier()
      .setSigningAlgorithm('HS256')
      .setSigningKey(found.secret)
      .verify(token, function (err, res) {
        if (res.body.hello !== claims.hello)
          throw(new Error('lookup didnt work'))
      });
```
